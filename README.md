# RAG Chatbot in AmazonBedrock

RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot is an AI chatbot with a technique that enhances AI language models by providing documentation as the data source, enabling the chatbot to provide accurate and up-to-date responses, even if the required information is latest and unavailable online.

AWS services I used in this project were Amazon Bedrock, S3, and OpenSearch Serverless. Key concepts include storing data in S3, creating a Knowledge Base, requesting access to AI models, how chatbot generates responses (i.e. AI models + Knowledge Base), and vector stores. 

## Objective
Since my best friend recently got engaged to his girlfriend, I wanted to give them a gift that is something unique, meaningful, and a little humorous. Then I decided to build an application integrated with a RAG chatbot that answers questions about him so that his fianc√©e can learn more about him in a fun way, helping them start their new life together with laughter and deeper understanding. 

## Workflow
1. **Store Data in S3** - Stored relevant documentation in **Amazon S3** as the chatbot's data source.
2. **Create a Knowledge Base** - Created a Knowledge Base in **Amazon Bedrock** to enable retrieval-based AI responses.
3. **Request Access to AI Models** - Selected and requested access to specific AI models, enabling the AI models to convert search results into human-like text.
4. **Configure Vector Store** - Used **OpenSearch Serverless** for vector-based search, allowing efficient retrieval of relevant information.
5. **Sync Knowledge Base** - Synchronized the data from **S3** to the **Knowledge Base** to ensure the following three keys:
   - **Ingesting**: Bedrock takes the data from S3.
   - **Processing**: Bedrock chunks and embeds the data.
   - **Storing**: Bedrock stores the processed data in the vector store (OpenSearch Serverless).

By following these flows, the AI chatbot is transformed into the **RAG chatbot**, significantly improving its ability to generate informed responses.
